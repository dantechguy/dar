    - Purpose is to be a general, *nice*, extensible interface for
      adding geometry to a scene. Supports flipping, stretching geometry,
      loading from files, etc.
    - Have pre-built shapes like cube, pyramid, etc.
    - Have all support transform/translate, and add convenience methods
      to the group
    - OR! it can simply apply them directly to the DrenderTree results it
      gets back from its children when running `computeTree`
